If local police do not enforce this law, the local government may lose funding for h-less projects, housing, counseling services, job training, and food stamps.  Before 1/1/23, the police picked up h-less and moved them around to other locales. The police mostly gave up on arresting h-less because it took the police hours to process a person. Then the municipal courts would let the h-less go back to the streets. Outstanding warrants inhibit h-less from getting jobs, housing and services. Many h-less have outstanding low-level warrants.","action":["Cooperation between Outreach Workers, police and courts could streamline the housing/counseling process. Police and/or Outreach Worker could query the sheriff/courts to establish the number of outstanding warrants the h-less person had. Assurances could be made that the h-less person would not be arrested.","Since SB 1606 was passed, the police are forced to arrest h-less. They query databases of warrants. The low-level warrants could easily be recalled by courts if a system were to be installed. The judges would like it because the h-less person would be properly served and the court's case load would be reduced. The backlog of warrants would be reduced. The police would like it because the unpleasant duty of arresting h-less on state property would be reduced. It turns out that Kansas City does not have enough jail beds to accommodate all the h-less who are arraigned. The Outreach Workers would like it because it would streamline their acquisition of client identification, removal of warrant fear and placement into housing that coordinates with police and courts."],"founder":"William Kirby","technologies":[],"website":null,"image":"https://democracylab-marlok.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails%2Fmark%40democracylab.org%2FnewFile.jpeg_1684338966.7395074.jpeg","contactInfo":null},{"projectTitle":"ALDAYA","problem":"Amplify the voices of indigenous peoples of Brazil.\r\nWe are bridging the indigenous wisdom of native peoples of Brazil with mainstream cultures in order to first create awareness of their traditions, knowledge and needs, and secondly to raise financial resources to support the preservation of their memories, traditions and territories through artistic entrepreneurship.","action":["Create a philanthropic shop with art made by indigenous peoples as a means to tell their stories, create personal relationships with native peoples. bring awareness to who they are as peoples, as culture, as sovereign communities.","Sell indigenous arts, share a blog with stories about the indigenous peoples of Brazil, and create a channel for donations for projects that support economic autonomy through art in indigenous communities."],"founder":"Marina Szarfarc","technologies":[],"website":"www.aldaya.org","image":"https://democracylab-marlok.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails%2Fmarina%40aldaya.org%2FnewFile.jpeg_1670887722.2455997.jpeg","contactInfo":[{"platform":"Instagram","link":"https://www.instagram.com/al.daya/"},{"platform":"Facebook","link":"https://www.facebook.com/aldaya.org/"}]},{"projectTitle":"SEEDS Regenerative Shopping Assistant","problem":"Thank you for what you are doing ♥\r\n######################################\r\nNOTE: This is a DAO (a decentralized autonomous organization) where you are encouraged to be proactive and approach team members independently.
